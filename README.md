Enterprise Knowledge Chatbot (Open-Source RAG Architecture)

‚ú® Introduction
Welcome to the Enterprise Knowledge Chatbot project! This is an open-source implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to help employees quickly access and leverage your organization's internal knowledge base through natural language conversations.

Problem: Enterprises struggle with information silos, making it difficult for employees to find answers within vast internal document repositories.

Solution: This chatbot connects to your company's documents, understands your queries, and provides context-aware answers, powered by cutting-edge AI.

üöÄ  üõ†Ô∏è Key Features
Automated Knowledge Ingestion: Daily indexing of documents from MinIO using Airflow.
Semantic Search: Fast and accurate retrieval of relevant information via ChromaDB.
AI-Powered Answers: Context-aware responses generated by OpenAI's LLM.
Chat History: Persistent conversation context managed by PostgreSQL.
Performance Caching: Redis for faster responses and cost optimization.
Intuitive UI: Built with Streamlit for easy user interaction.
Robust Backend: FastAPI serves as the API gateway.*
